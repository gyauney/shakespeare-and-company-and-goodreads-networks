    "This notebooks performs a network analysis of readership in two networks: Shakespeare and Company borrowers and another of Goodreads reviewers. In both networks, books are nodes and edges are created between nodes when the same person reads both of them (more readers reading the same two books = higher edge weight). The Goodreads dataset has been winnowed to include only books that were in the Shakespeare and Co library. "

Core-periphery structure studies how networks can be divided into a core of densely interconnected nodes, which are highly connected to other core nodes, and periphery nodes that are connected only to core nodes and not each other. This paper develops/assesses two core-periphery model types: the hub-and-spoke model that divides the network into two clean blocks (core vs. periphery) and a layered model that allows for layers of periphery-ness.

    "There are multiple ways to assess centrality in a network. Centrality measures usually try to capture something similar to significance or importance in a network--but there are different ways to understand importance. This code looks at the following:\n",
    "- **degree centrality:** the sum of all of a node's edges. When considering S&C, a book with the highest number of degrees demonstrates that it was the book most often read with other books in the network. This is a measure of a type of popularity (*but remember -> this isn't the book checked out the most times, it's the book checked out the most times with any other book*).  \n",
    "- **betweeness centrality:** betweenness centrality disregards node degree, and instead focuses on path length for determining the most important nodes. This looks at shortest paths to figure out which nodes connect otherwise disparate parts of the network. \n",
    "- **eigenvector centrality:** eigenvector centrality accounts for whether or not a node is connected to many other high-degree nodes--this would make it a hub, and also accounts for a central node that may not have the highest # of degrees, but is highly important, regardless"
